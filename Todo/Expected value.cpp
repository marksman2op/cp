/*
    Expected Value (EV):
    - EV is the mean value of a numerical experiment over many repetitions of the experiment.
    - For discrete random variable, EV can be calculated by multiplying each numerical outcome by the probability 
      of that outcome and then summing those products together.
      Let X be a discrete random variable. Then, the EV of X = E[X] = μ = ∑ x * P(X = x), over all possible outcomes x.

    - Linearity of EV: Let X and Y be random variable and c is a constant. Then,  
        E[X + c] = E[X] + c
        E[c * X] = c * E[X]
        E[X + Y] = E[X] + E[Y]

    - A rule of thumb: If there is word "probability" or "expected value" in the problem statement, then the solution 
      probably uses DP (and of course uses probabiltiy).
